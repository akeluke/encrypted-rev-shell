## A 64bit Linux Reverse Shell run over TLS

This project is based on some coursework set by my University, it is far from being complete
and requires much more work. However, I am continuously improving it.

Some basic features currently include: 
- Connection using OpenSSL v.3
- Full TTy shell on client using forkpty()
- Functionality to Download and Upload files to and from server

## TODO:
- Provide Build Instructions
- Allow for building of only client or server to reduce file size
- Modify client code for cross-platform compatibility (Windows specifically)
- Fix hefty amount of bugs
- Improve code readability


# DISCLAIMER
This application has been developed for research purposes, and SHOULD NOT be used for any malicious purposes
and this is an example of how a reverse shell may bypass firewalls etc so these systems can be improved to catch adversaries.
